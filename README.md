# Cultural-Bias
Creating a Rigorous Cultural Bias Benchmark for Autoregressive Large Language Models

A research project for the MIT NLP course, building on prior work that measures cultural alignment. The approach improves upon previous methods by making the metric differentiable, utilizing the difference in cross-entropies between the model and target cultures rather than traditional counting-based techniques.
